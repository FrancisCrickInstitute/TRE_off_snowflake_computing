{#
In this script we create a database along with 2 core roles RO (read only) and RW (read write)
this is to ensure we have a way to manage permissions in a consistant manner, 
in addition to which we are requesting we add comments to all objects so we are able to make sense of 
why they were created and how they are linked. 
#}

{#
To create a database we need the following variables: 
    databases [VARIABLE SET]
        db_name [STRING]
        comment [STRING]
#}
{% for db in databases %}
USE ROLE SYSADMIN;
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS {{ db.db_name }}
WITH COMMENT = '{{ db.comment }}';

USE ROLE SECURITYADMIN;
CREATE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS ROLE_{{ db.db_name }}_RO
WITH COMMENT = 'Role that can read all objects in schemas in {{ db.db_name }}';
CREATE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS ROLE_{{ db.db_name }}_RW
WITH COMMENT = 'Role that can read and write to all objects in schemas in {{ db.db_name }}';

GRANT USAGE ON ALL SCHEMAS IN DATABASE {{ db.db_name }}
TO ROLE ROLE_{{ db.db_name }}_RO;
GRANT USAGE ON FUTURE SCHEMAS IN DATABASE {{ db.db_name }}
TO ROLE ROLE_{{ db.db_name }}_RO;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN DATABASE {{ db.db_name }}
TO ROLE ROLE_{{ db.db_name }}_RO;
GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE TABLES IN DATABASE {{ db.db_name }}
TO ROLE ROLE_{{ db.db_name }}_RO;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL VIEWS IN DATABASE {{ db.db_name }}
TO ROLE ROLE_{{ db.db_name }}_RO;
GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE VIEWS IN DATABASE {{ db.db_name }}
TO ROLE ROLE_{{ db.db_name }}_RO;


GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL SCHEMAS IN DATABASE {{ db.db_name }}
TO ROLE ROLE_{{ db.db_name }}_RW;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON FUTURE SCHEMAS IN DATABASE {{ db.db_name }}
TO ROLE ROLE_{{ db.db_name }}_RW;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN DATABASE {{ db.db_name }}
TO ROLE ROLE_{{ db.db_name }}_RW;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON FUTURE TABLES IN DATABASE {{ db.db_name }}
TO ROLE ROLE_{{ db.db_name }}_RW;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL VIEWS IN DATABASE {{ db.db_name }}
TO ROLE ROLE_{{ db.db_name }}_RW;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON FUTURE VIEWS IN DATABASE {{ db.db_name }}
TO ROLE ROLE_{{ db.db_name }}_RW;



-- snowflake best practice is to ensure all custom roles go to SYSADMIN
GRANT ROLE ROLE_{{ db.db_name }}_RO
TO ROLE SYSADMIN; 
GRANT ROLE ROLE_{{ db.db_name }}_RW
TO ROLE SYSADMIN;
