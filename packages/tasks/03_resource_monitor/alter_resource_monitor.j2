{#
This script allows us to modify the resource monitor and will only execute elements 
of the script where we provide a variable. Where we need 2 variables they have been grouped
together in an if statement. 

We cannot rename a resource monitor so that option has not been made avaiable. 
#}
{#
To alter resource monitor we need the following variables:
NOTE: with the exception of frequency and start_timestamp which are needed as a pair all other variables are optional
    resource_monitors [VARIABLE SET]
        resource_monitor_name [STRING]
        credit_quota [NUMBER]
        frequency [DAY/MONTH/YEAR/NEVER]
        start_timestamp [IMMEDIATE/DATETIME]
        end_timestamp [DATETIME]
        notify_percent [NUMBER]
        suspend_percent [NUMBER]
        suspend_immediate_percent [NUMBER]
        resource_monitor_name [STRING]
        resource_monitor_role [STRING]
