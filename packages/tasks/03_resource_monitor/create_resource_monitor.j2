{#
It is important to remember this script will only create a resource monitor, 
we still need to assign it to the relevant object (account, warehouse)

once we get to the end timestamp date the object will be suspended we should 
be careful with this field specially when assigning a resource monitor to an Account

To create a database we need the following variables: 
    resource_monitors [VARIABLE SET]
        resource_monitor_name [STRING]

        suspend_immediate_percent [NUMBER]
        resource_monitor_name [STRING]
        resource_monitor_role [STRING]
