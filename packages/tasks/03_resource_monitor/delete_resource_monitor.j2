{#
A resource monitor can be deleted without any impact on the objects that are linked to it
this will mean any restrictions applied by the resource monitor on objects will disappear
#}
{#
To delete a database we need the following variables: 
    resource_monitors [VARIABLE SET]
        resource_monitor_name [STRING]
#}
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
{% for rm in resource_monitors %}
DROP RESOURCE MONITOR IF EXISTS {{ rm.resource_monitor_name }};
{% endfor %}
