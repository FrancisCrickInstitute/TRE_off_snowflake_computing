{#
The create warehouse script allows us to create a unit of compute in snowflake 
without this we cannot query the data or perform any analysis  tasks.
We use the SYSADMIN role to create the warehouse and are also creating roles that allows us to use the 
warehouse, using this we will be able to allow only specific roles that can access warehouses 
and we can monitor the costs for all the work that is being done in snowflake
#}

{#
To create a warehouse we need the following variables:
    warehouse [VARIABLE SET]
      wh_name [STRING]
      rename [STRING]
      wh_size [STRING]
      auto_suspend_seconds [STRING]
      auto_resume [STRING]
      comment [STRING]
      resource_monitor_name [STRING]
#}
CREATE WAREHOUSE IF NOT EXISTS {{ wh.wh_name }} 
WITH WAREHOUSE_SIZE = {{ wh.wh_size }} 
WAREHOUSE_TYPE = 'STANDARD' 
AUTO_SUSPEND = {{ wh.auto_suspend_seconds }} 
AUTO_RESUME = {{ wh.auto_resume }} 
COMMENT = '{{ wh.comment }}';

USE ROLE SECURITYADMIN; 

CREATE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS ROLE_{{ wh.wh_name }} 
WITH COMMENT = 'Role created to allow usage of {{ wh.wh_name }} warehouse';

GRANT OPERATE, USAGE ON WAREHOUSE {{ wh.wh_name }} 
TO ROLE ROLE_{{ wh.wh_name }};


{% if 'resource_monitor_name' in wh  and wh.resource_monitor_name -%}

USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
ALTER WAREHOUSE {{ wh.wh_name }} 
SET RESOURCE_MONITOR = {{ wh.resource_monitor_name }};

USE ROLE SECURITYADMIN;
{% endif -%}

-- Granting SYSADMIN the ability to modify the warehosue 
GRANT OPERATE,USAGE,MONITOR,MODIFY ON WAREHOUSE {{ wh.wh_name }} 
TO ROLE SYSADMIN; 

--following snowflake best practice and granting all custom roles to sysadmin
GRANT ROLE ROLE_{{ wh.wh_name }}
