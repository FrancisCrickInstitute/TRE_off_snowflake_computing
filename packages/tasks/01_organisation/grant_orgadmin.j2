{# 
In Snowflake you cannot create Organisations we need to email Snowflake Support and ask that this be setup
in the script below we are granting ORGADMIN role to a user. This role has the abiltity to create other snowflake accounts 
and should not be granted to all users but only a serlect few and to the service account 
that will be used to provision new snowflake accounts. 
Once the accounts are created the ORGADMIN has no control on the new snowflake account- That can only be managed by 
the accountadmin role for the new snowflake account. 
#}

{#
To grant ORGADMIN priviledge we need the following variables: 
    users [VARIABLE SET]
        user_name [STRING]
#}
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN; 
{% for user in users %}
GRANT ROLE ORGADMIN TO USER {{ user.user_name }};
{% endfor %}
